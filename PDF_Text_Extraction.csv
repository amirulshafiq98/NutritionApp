                   General labelling requirements for the use of the Healthier Choice Symbol

HPB reserves the right to make changes to the HCS guidelines at any time.

In line with the national nutrient claim guidelines, comparative claims e.g. Lower in sugar, are to carry a statement on the
label qualifying the comparison. This edition/version of HCS guidelines carries nutritional taglines including, lower in
sugar, lower in sodium, lower in saturated fat, higher in calcium and trans-fat free.

An example of the statement is ""25% lower in sugar as compared to regular [range or name of food category]"" or any other
statement bearing similar meaning.

The HCS programme focuses on promoting a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle and is used to help consumers in
making an informed choice when grocery shopping. Therefore, all product packaging and advertising materials are to
carry the message ‘Eat All Foods in Moderation’ to encourage consumers to have a balanced diet.

Mandatory primary taglines are pre-allocated. Manufacturers may consider an optional second nutrient tagline indicated
in parenthesis { } under each sub-food category or an optional second nutrient tagline based on the criteria under each sub-
food category, unless otherwise stated.

Categories under HCS are generally assessed based on per 100ml prepared or ready to consume for beverages or per 100g
for food.

                                             Sugar

All “sugar” targets follow the WHO definition for free sugars. This includes all monosaccharides and disaccharides
added to foods by the manufacturer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices. This definition
excludes lactose and galactose if naturally present in milk. Deionised fruit juice is also considered free sugar. Where
there are “No added sugar” guidelines or taglines, it means that no free sugars should be added to the product.

                                         Partially Hydrogenated Oils (PHO)

The PHO ban in Singapore is in effect in June 2021. As of this revision of the guidelines, HCS products should be PHO-
free or meet the relevant category guidelines.

                                              Beverages

The Nutri-Grade label for all pre-packaged non-alcoholic beverages sold in Singapore will come into effect on 30 Dec
2022. After the Nutri-Grade is in effect, the HCS must not be used on products with a Nutri-Grade label of C or D. HCS
can be used concurrently with a Nutri-Grade label of A or B if the product meets both the requirements for Grades A or
B under the Nutri-Grade label, and the HCS criteria.

# Foods carrying the HCS Low Glycemic Index claim must fulfil all of the following criteria

    1.  Food products must first meet all the HCS nutrient guidelines as specified in the category the product falls under,
        before it can apply for the Low GI claim.

    2. Must have a GI value* of less than 55.
       *The cut-off values for the classification of low, medium and high GI are standardised internationally (ISO
        26642:2010).

    3. Product eligibility for GI testing:
         At least 7.5g of carbohydrate per serving of the food product (This amount of carbohydrate should be present
            to qualify for GI testing)
       OR
        50% of the macronutrient must be carbohydrates.

    4.  Products which do not meet the carbohydrate criteria for GI testing will be evaluated on a case by case basis.

{ } Denotes an optional secondary tagline.

* Whole-grains content can be calculated by expressing the total amount of whole-grain ingredients used as a proportion
of the weight of the final / finished product. An example is shown below

 % wholegrains                                     150g/450(g)x100% = 33.3%

**Labelling requirements for carrying the HCS with “Higher in wholegrains” claim

(i) Declaration of wholegrains content based on weight of final product
    e.g. Wholegrain wheat (44%), oats (12%), brown rice (20%) or ;
    e.g. As a front / back of pack labelling statement “Contains x% of wholegrains”.

(ii) Declaration of wholegrains content per serving expressed as a percentage of the daily requirement. The daily whole-
   grain requirement is taken as 50g.
    e.g. “2 slices of [name of bread] will provide you with [x%] of your daily wholegrain requirement;
    e.g. “1 serving of [name of food product] will provide you with [x%] of your daily wholegrain requirement”

Optional health message on Wholegrain products
Manufacturers may place the following health message on wholegrain products bearing the “Higher in wholegrains” HCS
tagline

   •   “Wholegrains are essential part of a nutritious^ diet. As wholegrains contain all parts of the grain (germ, bran and
       endosperm), it is healthier^ than refined grains. Examples of wholegrain foods are wholemeal bread, brown rice
       and [name  of  food  category*].  For more  tips on  healthy  eating,  visit HPB’s Food  For  Health  at
       www.hpb.gov.sg/foodforhealth”

       ^To qualify, Products will need to carry the HCS “Higher in wholegrains” tagline and display the NIP
       *Manufacturers may choose the third example of the food category from the list of oats, wholegrain breakfast
        cereals, brown rice vermicelli, wholemeal crackers, whole durum wheat pasta.

Energy drinks

Energy drinks will not be eligible for HCS. Energy drinks are non-alcoholic beverages that contain caffeine, vitamins and
other ingredients for example, taurine, ginseng, and guarana. They are typically marketed as being able to boost energy
and increase physical and mental performance.

2   Includes raw oats, rolled oats, instant and cooking oats/oatmeal

3   Includes instant oatmeal with added ingredients

4  Products with fat contents that exceed the criteria but <10% will be accepted if the saturated fat % is <20% of the
    total fat.

(a) Targets are for free sugar only, as per WHO definition. Sugar from plain dried fruit (i.e. sugar coated or treated fruit is
   excluded) is exempt from this definition. Businesses will need to provide a declaration and calculation to show the
   estimation of sugar from dried fruits in their products.

 (b) Products with fat level marginally above 2% will be accepted if the source of fat is naturally occurring from the
   whole-grains used.

(c) Based on final weight of product

(d) Products in this category must meet both the wholegrain and dietary fibre requirements.

*Whole-grains content can be calculated by expressing the total amount of whole-grain ingredients used as a proportion
of the weight of the final / finished product. An example is shown below

*Labelling requirements for carrying the HCS with “Higher in wholegrains” claim

(i) Declaration of wholegrains content based on weight of final product
    e.g. Wholegrain wheat (44%), oats (12%), brown rice (20%) or;
    e.g. As a front / back of pack labelling statement “Contains x% of wholegrains”.

(ii) Declaration of wholegrains content per serving expressed as a percentage of the daily requirement. The daily whole-
   grain requirement is taken as 50g.
    e.g. “2 slices of [name of bread] will provide you with [x%] of your daily wholegrain requirement;
    e.g. “1 serving of [name of food product] will provide you with [x%] of your daily wholegrain requirement”

Optional health message on Wholegrain products
Manufacturers may place the following health message on wholegrain products bearing the “Higher in wholegrains” logo

   •   “Wholegrains are essential part of a nutritious^ diet. As wholegrains contain all parts of the grain (germ, bran and
       endosperm), it is healthier^ than refined grains. Examples of wholegrain foods are wholemeal bread, brown rice
       and [name  of  food  category*].  For more  tips on  healthy  eating,  visit HPB’s Food  For  Health  at
       www.hpb.gov.sg/foodforhealth”

       ^To qualify, Products will need to carry the HCS “Higher in wholegrains” logo and display the NIP
       *Manufacturers may choose the third example of the food category from the list of oats, wholegrain breakfast
        cereals, brown rice vermicelli, wholemeal crackers, whole durum wheat pasta.

Foods carrying the HCS Low Glycemic Index claim must fulfil all of the following criteria

    1. Food products must first meet all the HCS nutrient guidelines as specified in the category the product falls under,
       before it can apply for the Low GI claim.

    2. Must have a GI value* of less than 55.

       *The cut-off values for the classification of low, medium and high GI are standardised internationally (ISO
        26642:2010).

    3. Product eligibility for GI testing@:
         At least 7.5g of carbohydrate per serving of the food product (This amount of carbohydrate should be present
            to qualify for GI testing)
         Or
        50% of the macronutrient must be carbohydrates.

# Foods carrying the HCS Low Glycemic Index claim must fulfil all the following criteria

    1.  Food products must first meet all the HCS nutrient guidelines as specified in the category the product falls under,
        before it can apply for the Low GI claim.

    2. Must have a GI value* of less than 55.

       *The cut-off values for the classification of low, medium and high GI are standardised internationally (ISO
        26642:2010).

    3. Product eligibility for GI testing:
         At least 7.5g of carbohydrate per serving of the food product (This amount of carbohydrate should be present
            to qualify for GI testing)
         Or
        50% of the macronutrient must be carbohydrates.

    4.  Products which do not meet the carbohydrate criteria for GI testing will be evaluated on a case by case basis."

**Labelling requirements for carrying the HCS with “Higher in wholegrains” claim

(i) Declaration of wholegrains content based on weight of final product
    e.g. Wholegrain wheat (44%), oats (12%), brown rice (20%) or ;
    e.g. As a front / back of pack labelling statement “Contains x% of wholegrains”.

(ii) Declaration of wholegrains content per serving expressed as a percentage of the daily requirement. The daily whole-grain requirement is taken as 50g.
    e.g. “2 slices of [name of bread] will provide you with [x%] of your daily wholegrain requirement;
    e.g. “1 serving of [name of food product] will provide you with [x%] of your daily wholegrain requirement”

Optional health message on Wholegrain products
Manufacturers may place the following health message on wholegrain products bearing the “Higher in wholegrains” HCS tagline

   •   “Wholegrains are essential part of a nutritious^ diet. As wholegrains contain all parts of the grain (germ, bran and endosperm), it is healthier^ than refined grains. Examples of
       wholegrain foods are wholemeal bread, brown rice and [name of food category*]. For more tips on healthy eating, visit HPB’s Food For Health at www.hpb.gov.sg/foodforhealth”
       ^To qualify, Products will need to carry the HCS “Higher in wholegrains” tagline and display the NIP
       *Manufacturers may choose the third example of the food category from the list of oats, wholegrain breakfast cereals, brown rice vermicelli, wholemeal crackers, whole durum wheat
        pasta.
